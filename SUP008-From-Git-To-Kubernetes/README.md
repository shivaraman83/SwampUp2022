![Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 9 31 16 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2287053/168729373-27add5ef-c6ae-48b4-bccf-f215286c0bc9.png)


### In this training session, you’ll learn best-practices when using the JFrog Platform to store and manage your Docker images and Kubernetes deployments from beginning to end, while also setting up a continuous build, test and deploy pipeline. We’ll cover best practices for managing and creating Docker registries and Helm repositories, testing and promotion of Docker containers, and taking your containers all the way to production using the JFrog Platform and Kubernetes together. While the use cases discussed will cover and utilize the entire JFrog Platform, the majority of the hands-on training will focus on JFrog Artifactory and CI tools working together.


#### <ins>Who should attend:</ins> Developers, Development Managers, and DevOps Engineers who are currently using JFrog Artifactory and Docker, Current Docker users who are considering using JFrog Artifactory. A good understanding of Docker containers and CI servers for cloud-native pipelines is required. 

#### <ins>Prerequisites</ins>: Knowledgeable with Git and Docker (git and docker clients installed including having a GitHub account). Basic understanding of DevOps concepts (familiarity with JFrog Artifactory).

### <ins>Lab #1 - Onboarding to Labs Environment</ins>

- Commit the changes to your forked repository:
 ```
git add .
git commit -m "updated my repo path in the source code resource"
git push
```
- Create the following Integrations (Administration Panel -> Pipelines -> Integrations -> Add an Integration), while using your SaaS instance values:
    - "github" integration (type: "GitHub") with [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) from your github account:</br>

### <ins>Lab #2 - Understanding the Environment</ins>

Complete/answer the following tasks/questions:
- Run all pipelines until your environment is GREEN:</br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bP4tRcY/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-14-34-34.png" width="55%" height="55%"></br>
- Understand the relationship between the different pipelines - in what ways a pipeline can be triggered?
- How many repositories were created for the backend application?
- How many repositories were created for the frontend application?

### <ins>Lab #3 - Adding Security</ins>

- Index all builds from Xray's Administration Panel (Xray -> Settings -> Builds):</br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/T4cLCsp/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-15-21-48.png" width="55%" height="55%"></br>
- View the security issues and license discovered by Xray for every individual build.
- Add one Security and one License Policies: [Creating a Policy](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Creating+Xray+Policies+and+Rules#CreatingXrayPoliciesandRules-CreatingaPolicy).
- Add a watch per application (one watch for the backend; one watch for the frontend) and assign the policies you have created to these watches: [Configure Xray Watches](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray+Watches).
- Explore the violations that were NOW created.

### <ins>Extras - Do it yourself!</ins>

##### <ins>1 Bonus - Creating a Release Bundle & Distributing to Edge</ins></br>
- From Distribution UI, [Creating a Release Bundle](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Distributing+Release+Bundles#DistributingReleaseBundles-CreatingaNewReleaseBundle) that contains:
